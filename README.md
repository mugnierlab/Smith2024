identifying mosaic VSGs

VSG-AMP-Seq: A detailed Readme can be found within the VSG-AMP-Seq Folder. A vignette is included.

Figures: all code used to generate figures is present in each subfolder. Relevant data needed to generate the figures is also present.

VSG_clustering: two alternative clustering methods were used to cluster VSGs into families. The code used to obtain these clusters and the resulting clustered outputs are in this folder.

VSgnome_analysis: Additional VSG-encoding genes were identified in the 2018 Lister Genome (MÃ¼ller et al., 2018 Nature).

This script runs the pipeline - many large data files were organized into folders with paths relative to the working directory containing the scripts. Most data files are found on TriTrypDB.com. ABEX7_all_orfs.fa is from Beaver et al. 2024. All data files can be provided upon request, but are too large for upload onto github.
